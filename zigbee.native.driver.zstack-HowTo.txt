Packages:

com.itaca.ztool.api:		Classes that implement the driver
com.itaca.ztool.api.system:	Classes representing the ZTool SYS messages
com.itaca.ztool.api.af:		Classes representing the ZTool AF messages
com.itaca.ztool.api.zdo:	Classes representing the ZTool ZDO messages
com.itaca.ztool.api.simple:	Classes representing the ZB simple API messages
com.itaca.ztool.api.old:	Classes representing messages from the previous version not present in current documentation(not supported).
com.itaca.ztool.util:		Utilities adapted for ZTool characteristics

How To Use:

Instantiate class "ZTool". Use its methods:

-sendAsynchronous(message)
	Sends a previously constructed message (sys/zdo/af) through the serial port.
-sendSynchronous(message)
	Sends a previously constructed message through the serial port and waits for the appropriate response.
-getResponse()
	Receives a message from the serial. The returned message should be properly casted
	to the appropiate message according to its CMD field.

***OR***

Create a class that implements interface ZToolHandler and pass it to ZTool when calling:

	ZToolInstance.open(COM,Rate,*YourHandlerHere*);

instead of:

	ZToolInstance.open(COM,Rate);

Response packets will be sent to method handlePacket of the interface as they arrive. Handle them as you please.
Requests should still be sent via ZTool with sendAsynchronous as shown above.



EXAMPLE
